# Top-Countries-Per-Applications-Google-Script
The `findTopCountry` function, also known as "Top countries per applications," operates within a Google Spreadsheet to determine the top countries based on application counts across multiple monthly sheets. It initializes with a predefined list of sheet names and a container for product counts. It then accesses each sheet to gather product data, calculating frequencies and identifying the top three countries by application count. Finally, it updates specific cells in the "Welcome" sheet to display these top countries. This script is essential for tracking and visualizing application trends across different months within a spreadsheet context.
